## Quickstart

To get started with this project, you must have Node v6.9.1 or higher installed on your computer.

You will also need the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager installed:

$ npm i -g yarn
```


To install the dependencies for the project

```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can build and start the Express server by running

```

## More help

To use a port besides the default `3000`, use an environment

$ export PORT=8080
```
